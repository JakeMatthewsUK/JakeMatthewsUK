Hi, I’m Jake Matthews.

I have a background in research science 🧬 but really enjoy writing code.󠁧󠁢󠁥 I kicked off with C++, making some console apps and solving HackerRank challenges. Since then I have made desktop (WinForms) and Full Stack web applications (ASP Core MVC) in C#.NET, built JavaScript web games and created a small business website using React.js. I am particularly interested in developing the functionality and UI elements of Full Stack software solutions.  

I'm open to new opportunities, so please contact me at if you want to discuss working together. I'm living in Gloucestershire, UK, but would also be able to work on a remote basis.
